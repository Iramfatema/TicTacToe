Concepts:
document.querySelector() is a function in JavaScript and it is used to select the first element that matches a specified CSS selector.
The querySelectorAll() method returns all elements that matches a CSS selector(s).

The querySelectorAll() method returns a NodeList.

The getAttribute() method is used to get the value of an attribute of the particular element. If the attribute exists, it returns the string representing the value of the corresponding attribute. If the corresponding attribute does not exist, it will return an empty string or null.

` ` is a template literal.

In JavaScript, backticks are used to create template literals, which allow for embedded expressions and multiline strings.
Template literals provide a convenient way to create strings with dynamic content in JavaScript.

cell => cell.textContent  : 
cell is the parameter of the arrow function. It represents each element in an array or any value passed as an argument when the function is called.
=> is the arrow function syntax itself. It separates the parameters from the function body.
cell.textContent is the expression to the right of the arrow, which represents the return value of the function. In this case, it's accessing the textContent property of the cell object.
Arrow functions are often used in JavaScript for their concise syntax, especially in situations where you need to pass a callback function, such as in array methods like map(), filter(), and forEach().


#next function:
should have a undo button to erase selected cell content.
